## 💭 The Why Behind This Project

My second project this month. It doesn't revolve around the cybersecurity field I'm studying—but it might be more important than any technical project I've built so far.

This was made to cure my own productivity crisis, and my thirst for accomplishment.

And like most people my age, I was drowning in distractions. I'd sit down to study, open my laptop, and somehow 3 hours would vanish into YouTube, Discord, anywhere but the work that actually mattered.

I knew what I needed to do. I had the motivation. But I couldn't make myself **do** it.

So I built something to hold me accountable. Not another generic Pomodoro timer. Not another to-do list app that I'd ignore after a week. Something with a soul. Something that would **notice** when I failed, and **celebrate** when I succeeded.

This is that something.

## 📊 The Reality We're All Facing

The productivity crisis isn't just me. It's all of us:

- **[80-95% of students procrastinate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9930256/)**, and only 44% of study time is spent on actual work
- **[Students switch from studying to social media after just 6 minutes](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130515091438.htm)**, and it takes 23 minutes to regain full concentration
- **[47% of students say time management is their biggest challenge](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-student-time-use-study/)**
- **[31% of students sleep 5 hours or less per night](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-student-time-use-study/)**, triggering a vicious cycle of burnout and poor performance

We're not lazy. We're not lacking discipline. We're fighting an attention economy designed to keep us distracted. Every app, every platform, every notification is engineered to steal our focus.

This tool is my rebellion against that.

## ✨ What Makes This Different

**Lofi Study Companion** isn't just another productivity app. It's a study partner that:

- **Notices when you get distracted** — Focus Mode tracks every time you switch tabs during work sessions
- **Holds you accountable emotionally** — Your companion (Mimi) reacts to your behavior: celebrating wins, showing concern when you struggle, encouraging you to try again
- **Builds streaks that matter** — Consecutive focused Pomodoros unlock celebrations and milestones
- **Creates consequences for distractions** — Too many tab switches break your streak. It hurts, and that's intentional
- **Rewards genuine focus** — Complete 3 Pomodoros with minimal distractions and watch the confetti fly

Most productivity apps are passive. They track time but don't *care*. Mimi cares. She's watching. She's rooting for you. And when you fail, she's disappointed—not angry, but disappointed in the way someone who believes in you would be.

That psychological pressure? That's what makes this work.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Lofi aesthetic meets emotional design.**

The interface is intentionally calm—muted purples, soft browns, gentle animations. It's designed to be a *sanctuary* from the chaos of the modern web, not another source of overstimulation.

But beneath that calm exterior is a system built on behavioral psychology:
- **Immediate feedback** — See consequences of your actions instantly
- **Social accountability** — Even a virtual companion creates pressure to perform
- **Intermittent rewards** — Streaks and celebrations tap into dopamine cycles (but productively)
- **Loss aversion** — Breaking a streak *hurts*, which motivates consistency

This isn't gamification for the sake of it. It's gamification designed to build real habits.

## 📖 My Journey

I started coding seriously this month. Before this, I had surface-level knowledge—enough to understand what code *was*, but not enough to *build* anything real.

In the past few weeks, I've built:
1. A password strength checker (3 different aesthetic versions)
2. This productivity companion

Every project teaches me something new. But this one taught me the most important lesson: **the best tools solve your own problems first.**

I didn't build this for a portfolio. I didn't build it to impress anyone. I built it because I *needed* it. And maybe you need it too.

- **Theme switcher** — Let users choose between Classical, Violet Evergarden, and Lofi styles
- **Custom Pomodoro lengths** — Not everyone works in 25-minute blocks
- **Better character sprites** — Replace emoji with actual pixel art animations
- **Weekly/monthly reports** — Visualize your productivity trends over time
- **Export data** — Download your stats as CSV
- **Sync across devices** — Cloud storage for your tasks and streaks
- **Spotify integration** — Let users play their own lofi playlists

## 💬 Feedback

If you use this and it helps you (or doesn't), I want to know. Open an issue, send me a message, or just let me know what worked and what didn't.

This is a learning project. I'm just trying to build things that matter while learning to code. So if the code is messy, if there are bugs, if things could be better. I'm working on it.
